Abstract: 
The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a large amount of experimental and observational studies reporting clear correlation between the risk of 
developing severe COVID-19 (or dying from it) and whether the individual is male or female. This paper is an attempt to explain the supposed male 
vulnerability to COVID-19 using a causal approach. We proceed by identifying a set of confounding and mediating factors, based on the review of 
epidemiological literature and analysis of sex-dis-aggregated data. Those factors are then taken into consideration to produce explainable and fair 
prediction and decision models from observational data. The paper outlines how non-causal models can motivate discriminatory policies such as biased 
allocation of the limited resources in intensive care units (ICUs). The objective is to anticipate and avoid disparate impact and discrimination, by 
considering causal knowledge and causal-based techniques to compliment the collection and analysis of observational big-data. The hope is to contribute 
to more careful use of health related information access systems for developing fair and robust predictive models.
